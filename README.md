# CS210FINALPROJECT Barbaros Acet 31143
# aim and hypothesis of the project: to find out if my listening habit matches my taste of music in general basis which corresponds to my playlists' songs.
# motivation of doing this project: I have always curious about how i represent my music taste to the outside world correlates what I generally listen on a day. I always thought that my listening habit does not match my representation of music taste (playlists) because spotify is no different than any other social media. It is there to show and represent your music taste for other people in order to gain social credits. So it was joyful to experiment my hypothesis using my own data.
#Findings: I actually found out various finding about my general music taste. What I search for in daily basis, how my music taste shapes my playlists' structure, how daily basis taste of music correlates with my playlists.
#Limitations and future work: the Main limitation is how spotify gives the data. It does not have very distinctive categories, it lacks of richness such as there is no mood, bpm or any other categorization for the songs. Future work can be done by further gathering the extended data from spotify which will result in a much more detailed observation.
#in Datacollect i gathered my data and carefully constructed the dataframes.
#in EDAskills i performed various visualizations and EDA principles upon my newly created dataframes.
#in Hypothesis Testing according to my hypothesis. and reach out a conclusion which supports my hypothesis using machine learning and confusion matrix.
