Abstract
This project aims to explore the correlation between an individual's private listening habits and their publicly shared music tastes, as represented by their playlists. It seeks to answer the question: does one's daily music listening align with the music they choose to publicly display on platforms like Spotify?

Introduction
Aim and Hypothesis
The primary objective is to determine if there's a match between my general music taste and the songs in my playlists. The hypothesis posits that there may be a discrepancy between these two aspects due to the social nature of platforms like Spotify, where users might curate playlists more for public image than personal preference.

Motivation
The motivation stems from a curiosity about the alignment of private music consumption with public representation. Spotify, akin to other social media platforms, serves as a medium to showcase oneâ€™s music taste, possibly influencing one's playlist choices for social validation. This project offers an opportunity to empirically test this hypothesis using personal Spotify data.

Methodology
Data Collection
The data was collected from my personal Spotify account. The process involved meticulous extraction and organization of data into structured dataframes for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Various EDA techniques and visualizations were employed to understand the characteristics and patterns within the data. This step was crucial in shaping the approach for subsequent hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis Testing
The project employed machine learning techniques and a confusion matrix to test the hypothesis. The goal was to analyze the congruence between my daily listening patterns and the songs in my playlists.

Findings
The analysis revealed several insights about my music preferences, including daily listening patterns and how these influence the structure of my playlists. It was found that there is a correlation between my daily music choices and the songs in my playlists.

Limitations and Future Work
A significant limitation is the nature of data provided by Spotify, which lacks depth in certain areas, such as mood, beats per minute (BPM), and other detailed song categorizations. Future research could involve collecting more extensive data from Spotify for a deeper analysis.

Conclusion
The findings support the hypothesis that my daily listening habits do not entirely align with the music I represent in my playlists. This discrepancy highlights the influence of social media dynamics on music representation.
